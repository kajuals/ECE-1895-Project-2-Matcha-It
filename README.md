# Matcha-It:

## Overview
Matcha-It is a simple interactive game. The system simulates the process of making matcha tea by issuing randomized audio commands — “Whisk It,” “Pour It,” or “Serve It.” Players must respond by pressing the corresponding physical button or toggle switch within a limited time. The system evaluates the response accuracy and timing, awarding points for correct inputs and terminating the game on incorrect or late actions. As the game progresses, response intervals shorten, increasing difficulty until the player reaches the maximum score of 99 points.

## Features
- Three unique player inputs: Pour, Whisk, Serve
- Real-time LED and audio feedback
- Progressive difficulty with shortening intervals
- ATmega microcontroller-based logic and sound playback
- Modular enclosure with realistic utensil simulation
